# User_Configurations
This repository contains my personal user configurations for a variety of different applications. For those who haven't used any of the following, I believe that these are very good starting points. Note that I personally did not make any of the following plugins and take no credit for them. I've created hyperlinks to the creators github accounts, for more information.

# VIM
## Plugins
<a href="https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree">NerdTree</a> - Activated by Ctrl-c. Brings up a navigations pane. Navigate by using Ctrl+(h,j,k,l). Useful when you don't quite know the contents of the program you're working on. If you do know the file name that you're looking for, I reccommend using Ctrl-p instead.
